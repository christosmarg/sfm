sfm - simple file manager
=========================

sfm is a minimal file manager for UNIX-based operating systems
that follows the suckless style of configuration.

Usage
-----
        cd sfm
        sudo make install clean

sfm will be installed in /usr/local/bin by default.
Configuration is done by editing config.h and recompiling the source code.

Note
----
This project is still early in development so you can't use sfm yet.
